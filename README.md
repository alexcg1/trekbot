# Trekbot

Trekbot is a just-for-fun project I'm doing to play with various machine learning tools, in the hope of generating new episodes of Star Trek. They will be deeply crappy, but potentially funny in a very surreal way.

## Script Writing

Performed by a notebook based on [cdpierse's script_buddy](https://github.com/cdpierse/script_buddy_v2), trained on all the script data from every Star Trek TV show before Discovery (yes, even the animated series).

## Voice Cloning

Once we've got a script, we need the characters to say their lines. We can do this with [voice cloning], based on [CorentinJ's repository](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning). Samples are downloaded from YouTube and edited to include only one character with as little background noise as possible.

## Video Wizardry

We've got the script, we've got the lines being spoken. Now we need to get the cast to "perform" them. For this I plan to play around with deepfake. I haven't started this yet, so no code right now.

## Future Plans

* Automate the workflow
* Do crossovers. For example I could train it on a mix of Star Wars and Star Trek and have a Borg Cube vs Death Star battle royale.
* Potentially write bots to speak in character's "voices" and say things they would be likely to say.

## Disclaimers

* All of this is just a personal exploration - I'll share my methods and some inputs, but due to the sensitive nature of some of these technologies, I won't be sharing the finished product. I don't want to get my ass sued after all.
* If you use my methods and notebooks, do it for good. Don't go around faking news or trying to blackmail celebs with deepfake. That's an asshole thing to do.

Do you work for the Star Trek production team and don't want to kick my ass for doing this? I'd love to hear from you! Or anyone else for that matter!
